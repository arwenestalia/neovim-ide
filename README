THIS PROJECT MOVED TO https://gitlab.com/arwenestalia/neovim-ide

Arwen Estalia's Neovim IDE
--------------------------

Upon request, this repository is a bundle of Neovim plugins and settings
which form a base for efficient text and source code editing.

The main components of the bundle are:
- Packer
- Telescope
- Treesitter

However this repository does not include:
- a collection of keymaps
- sane default settings
as those are too subjective to be included in a public repository.
This repository is meant as a reference or starting point for your
own Neovim configuration, not a drop-in all-in-one package that is
ready to use outside the box.


Installation
------------

1. Install packer (https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
2. git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/arwenestalia/neovim-ide ~/.config/nvim/lua/arwen


Usage
-----

Put the following at the start of your ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
followed by your personal config.

require("arwen").init({
--  arwen module config
})

Restart Neovim, ignore the presented errors and run :PackerSync
then restart Neovim again.
For available parameters and defaults check config.lua
